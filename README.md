# tinyniSh
`tinyniSh` is a simple shell program written in C. It supports:



## Compiling

You can use `gcc` to compile the source:

`gcc --std=gnu99 -o tinynish tinynish.c`

Or, if you want to get fancy, you can use the `CMake` build generation system:

`cmake -S . -B ./build/`

This will create a `build/` subdirectory which will, if you're on a Unix-based system, have a normal `Makefile`
